# Break-Even Analysis Calculator

Calculate the break-even point for a business - the minimum sales volume needed to cover all costs.

## What You Need

Ask the user for these three numbers:
1. **Fixed Costs** (monthly or annual) - rent, salaries, insurance, overhead
2. **Price per Unit** - what you sell each product/service for
3. **Variable Cost per Unit** - direct costs per unit (materials, labor, etc.)

## Calculation

```
Contribution Margin = Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit
Break-Even Units = Fixed Costs ÷ Contribution Margin
Break-Even Revenue = Break-Even Units × Price per Unit
Contribution Margin Ratio = Contribution Margin ÷ Price per Unit
```

## What to Explain

After calculating, explain:

1. **Break-Even Units**: "You need to sell [X] units to break even"
2. **Break-Even Revenue**: "That's [$ Y] in revenue to cover all costs"
3. **Contribution Margin**: "Each unit contributes $[Z] toward covering fixed costs"
4. **Profitability**: "Every unit above [X] units flows directly to profit at [ratio]%"

## Example

```
Fixed Costs: $10,000/month
Price per Unit: $50
Variable Cost per Unit: $20

Calculation:
Contribution Margin = $50 - $20 = $30
Break-Even Units = $10,000 ÷ $30 = 334 units
Break-Even Revenue = 334 × $50 = $16,700
Contribution Margin Ratio = $30 ÷ $50 = 60%

Result:
You need to sell 334 units ($16,700 in revenue) to break even.
Each unit contributes $30 (60%) toward covering fixed costs.
Every unit beyond 334 generates $30 in profit.
```

## Key Insights to Share

- If break-even seems unachievable with current pricing, they need to either:
  - Increase prices
  - Reduce variable costs
  - Reduce fixed costs
  - Or some combination

- A 60%+ contribution margin ratio is strong
- Below 40% contribution margin makes profitability difficult
