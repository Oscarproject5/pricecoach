# Gross Margin Calculator

Calculate gross margin and understand the critical difference between margin and markup.

## What You Need

Ask the user for:
1. **Revenue** (or Price per Unit)
2. **Cost of Goods Sold / COGS** (or Cost per Unit)

## Calculation

```
Gross Profit = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold
Gross Margin % = (Gross Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100
Markup % = (Gross Profit ÷ Cost of Goods Sold) × 100
```

## Critical: Margin vs. Markup

These are **NOT** the same! Most business owners confuse them:

**Example: $10 sells for $20**
- Gross Profit = $10
- **Margin** = $10 ÷ $20 = **50%** (profit as % of selling price)
- **Markup** = $10 ÷ $10 = **100%** (profit as % of cost)

**Key Difference:**
- Margin is always LOWER than markup
- Using the wrong one leads to severe underpricing

## Conversion Formulas

```
Markup % to Margin %:
Margin = Markup ÷ (1 + Markup)

Example: 100% markup = 100% ÷ 2 = 50% margin

Margin % to Markup %:
Markup = Margin ÷ (1 - Margin)

Example: 50% margin = 50% ÷ 50% = 100% markup
```

## Industry Benchmarks (Gross Margin %)

- **SaaS**: 70-80% (target)
- **Professional Services**: 50-60%
- **Restaurants**: 65-70% (food only), 3-5% net
- **Retail**: 30-50% (varies widely)
- **E-commerce**: 30-50%
- **Manufacturing**: 20-40%
- **Wholesale**: 15-30%

## What to Explain

After calculating:

1. **Your margin**: "Your gross margin is X%, which means..."
2. **Industry comparison**: "For [industry], typical is Y%, so you're [above/below] average"
3. **Margin vs markup**: Make sure they understand the difference
4. **Profitability**: "After gross margin, you still need to cover overhead, salaries, etc."
5. **Target**: What margin they should aim for in their industry

## Example

```
Revenue: $100,000
Cost of Goods Sold: $40,000

Calculation:
Gross Profit = $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000
Gross Margin % = ($60,000 ÷ $100,000) × 100 = 60%
Markup % = ($60,000 ÷ $40,000) × 100 = 150%

Result:
Your gross margin is 60%, which means 60 cents of every dollar
goes toward covering overhead and profit. This equals a 150% markup
on your costs.

For a professional services business, 60% gross margin is healthy.
This should leave you 15-20% net profit after covering all overhead.
```

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake #1: Incomplete Cost Calculation**
- Don't forget: shipping, returns, payment processing, packaging
- Use FULLY-LOADED costs, not just product cost

**Mistake #2: Confusing Margin and Markup**
- If you target "50% margin" but calculate as markup, you're leaving 33% on the table!
- Always clarify which one you're using

**Mistake #3: Same Margin for All Products**
- Different products can support different margins
- High-volume, low-complexity = lower margins OK
- Low-volume, high-value = need higher margins

## Quick Reference Table

| Markup | Margin |
|--------|--------|
| 25% | 20% |
| 50% | 33% |
| 100% | 50% |
| 150% | 60% |
| 200% | 67% |
| 300% | 75% |

Now ask the user for their revenue and costs, then calculate their margins!
