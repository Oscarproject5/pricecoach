# Stepdeck Pricing Strategy - Your Path to Profitability

## The Problem You Were Facing

**Current Revenue:** $10K/month (20 jobs at $500 each)

**The Hidden Issue:**
- 7 jobs per month take ALL DAY (8+ hours)
- These full-day jobs pay the same $500 as 3-hour jobs
- Customers aren't prepared, you wait for hours
- Some jobs fail completely = $0 revenue, lost entire day
- You're running at 45% capacity but feel busy
- **Your effective rate on bad jobs: $45-60/hour**

**Why You're Stuck:**
You're afraid to lose customers, so you take ANY job at $500. Bad jobs consume your time, prevent you from marketing, and keep your calendar empty of GOOD jobs.

## The Solution: Tiered Pricing + Load-Ready Requirements

### TIER 1: Load-Ready Jobs - $500
**30-mile radius | Standard Service**

**Customer Requirements:**
- ✅ Load ready to go when you arrive
- ✅ Forklift or loading equipment ON SITE and OPERATIONAL
- ✅ Load accessible (not buried in warehouse/yard)
- ✅ Someone on-site to operate equipment
- ✅ Paperwork ready
- ✅ Load prepared and organized

**Your Policy:**
- You wait maximum 15 minutes after arrival
- After 15 minutes, you leave and charge $200 trip fee
- This protects your time and incentivizes customers to be ready

**Best For:**
- Professional businesses with loading equipment
- Customers who value efficiency
- Repeat customers who understand your process

---

### TIER 2: Assisted Loading - $900-1,200
**30-mile radius | Coordination Required**

**When to Use This Tier:**
- Customer doesn't have their own loading equipment
- They arrange and PAY for loading service BEFORE you arrive
- Load is ready and accessible
- You coordinate timing so all parties arrive together

**Your Policy:**
- Customer must confirm loading service is scheduled and paid
- All parties coordinate arrival within 30-minute window
- Load must be prepared and accessible
- You don't wait - if loading service is late, you reschedule at their cost

**Best For:**
- Customers who need help but are organized
- Businesses willing to invest in proper logistics
- One-time haulers who plan ahead

---

### TIER 3: Complex Jobs - $1,500+
**30-mile radius | High-Difficulty Service**

**Situations That Qualify:**
- Load not prepared when you arrive
- Need to wait for equipment/people (beyond 15 minutes)
- Special handling requirements
- Oversized or difficult loads
- Customer needs you to help coordinate multiple services
- Uncertain timeline or availability

**Your Policy:**
- Quote high because these eat your entire day
- Get 50% deposit upfront
- Bill hourly after first 4 hours ($150/hour)
- You control the timeline and expectations

**Alternative:**
- **You can choose NOT to take these jobs at all**
- Better to say "I'm not the right fit" and keep your calendar open

## Your Customer Qualification Script

### Initial Inquiry

**Customer:** "How much to haul [item] to [location]?"

**You:** "I can help you with that. To give you an accurate quote, I need to ask a few quick questions:

1. What exactly are we hauling? (dimensions, weight, type)
2. How far is the pickup and delivery? (within my 30-mile radius?)
3. **Do you have a forklift or loading equipment on site and ready to go when I arrive?**
4. Is the load accessible and prepared, or will it need to be dug out/organized?
5. Will someone be there to operate the equipment?"

---

### Scenario 1: They Have Equipment (TIER 1)

**Customer:** "Yes, we have a forklift and operator ready."

**You:** "Perfect! For a load-ready job within 30 miles, my rate is $500. That includes pickup and delivery. The load needs to be ready when I arrive - I can wait up to 15 minutes, but after that there's a $200 trip fee if I need to leave and reschedule. Does that work for you?"

**Customer:** "Yes, that works!"

**You:** "Great! Let me get your details and we'll schedule this..."

---

### Scenario 2: No Equipment But Willing to Arrange (TIER 2)

**Customer:** "No, we don't have a forklift."

**You:** "No problem. For jobs where loading equipment needs to be coordinated, my rate is $900. Here's how it works: you arrange and pay for a loading service to meet me on site, and we coordinate timing so everyone arrives together. I don't charge wait time as long as we're all synchronized. Does that work for your situation?"

**Customer:** "That's more than I expected..."

**You:** "I understand. My $500 rate is specifically for load-ready jobs where equipment is already on site. Coordinating additional services and ensuring tight timing is more complex, which is why it's priced differently. Would you like to explore arranging your own equipment to qualify for the $500 rate, or would you like to proceed at $900?"

---

### Scenario 3: Disorganized/Not Ready (TIER 3 or DECLINE)

**Customer:** "Well, we'll have someone there... probably. We might need you to wait while we figure it out."

**You:** "I appreciate your honesty. For jobs with uncertain timelines or wait time, my rate starts at $1,500 with a 50% deposit, and that's because these typically take my entire day. Alternatively, I'd recommend getting everything fully prepared and coordinated first, then reaching back out. I'm happy to help once you're ready, but I need to protect my schedule for load-ready customers."

**Customer:** "That's way too much! The other guy quoted $450!"

**You:** "That's great! Sounds like they're a good fit for you. Best of luck with your haul!"

**DO NOT CHASE THESE CUSTOMERS.**

---

## Handling Objections

### "That's too expensive!"

**Response:** "I understand pricing is important. My rates reflect the fact that I run a professional operation where your load gets picked up on time and delivered safely. If you're looking for the absolute cheapest option, I might not be the best fit - but if you value reliability and efficiency, I'm your guy."

---

### "The other company charges less!"

**Response:** "That's great! I hope they work out for you. If for any reason it doesn't, feel free to reach out and I'll be happy to help."

**DO NOT:**
- Match their price
- Badmouth competitors
- Try to convince them

**LET THEM GO.**

---

### "Can you do it for $450 this one time?"

**Response:** "I appreciate you asking, but my rates are my rates. $500 for load-ready jobs is already competitive for professional stepdeck service in this area. I can't go lower and maintain the quality and reliability you deserve."

---

### "I'm not sure if we'll be ready..."

**Response:** "No problem! Here's what I recommend: get everything 100% ready and confirmed, then give me a call. I'm happy to book you once you're certain the load and equipment will be ready. That way we both avoid wasted time and rescheduling fees."

## The Math: Why This Works

### Your Old Model (What Was Killing You)

- 20 jobs/month at $500 = $10,000 revenue
- 7 full-day disasters at $500 = $3,500 using 7 FULL DAYS
- 13 short jobs at $500 = $6,500 using ~6.5 days
- Total time: 13.5 days working
- Effective rate on disasters: $45-60/hour
- Net profit after costs: ~$7,200/month

### Your New Model (Conservative Estimate)

**If you cut the 7 disasters and replace with good jobs:**

- 13 existing good jobs at $500 = $6,500
- 7 days freed up = 14 more load-ready jobs at $500 = $7,000
- **Total: 27 jobs at $500 = $13,500/month**
- Costs: $3,780 (27 × $140)
- **Net profit: ~$9,720/month** (+35% increase)
- Working the SAME or LESS time

**If you convert just 3 of those to Tier 2:**

- 24 jobs at $500 = $12,000
- 3 jobs at $900 = $2,700
- **Total: $14,700/month revenue**
- Costs: $3,780
- **Net profit: ~$10,920/month** (+52% increase)

**If you get 5 Tier 2 jobs:**

- 22 jobs at $500 = $11,000
- 5 jobs at $900 = $4,500
- **Total: $15,500/month revenue**
- Costs: $3,780
- **Net profit: ~$11,720/month** (+63% increase)

## Red Flags - Jobs to Avoid or Price Higher

**Immediate RED FLAGS (Tier 3 or Decline):**

- "We'll figure out the loading when you get here"
- "Can you wait a couple hours while we..."
- "We're not sure exactly what we're shipping yet"
- "The machine might not be working"
- "We need to dig it out of the yard first"
- "Can you help us load other things too while you're here?"
- Customer has never shipped this type of load before
- Customer is vague about timing or availability
- Customer pushes back on basic qualification questions

**When You Hear These, Say:**

"Based on what you're describing, this sounds like it would fall into my complex jobs tier, which starts at $1,500. Alternatively, I'd recommend getting everything fully prepared and organized, then reaching back out. I'm happy to provide standard service at $500 once you're load-ready with equipment on site."

---

## Your Mantra

**"I run a professional stepdeck operation. I charge professional rates. Customers who value reliability and their own time will pay it. Customers who don't are not my customers."**

**REPEAT THIS when you're tempted to take a bad job.**

---

## The Goal: 30 Jobs at $500+ = $15K/Month

**Your Capacity:** 2 jobs/day × 22 working days = 44 jobs/month possible

**Target:** 30 jobs/month (68% capacity)

**Mix:**
- 25 Tier 1 jobs at $500 = $12,500
- 5 Tier 2 jobs at $900 = $4,500
- **Total: $17,000/month revenue**
- Costs: $4,200
- **Net profit: ~$12,800/month**

**That's a 78% increase from where you are now.**

And you'll work LESS because you're not wasting days on disasters.

---

## Final Thoughts

You've been undervaluing your service and your time. You run specialized equipment that requires expertise and professionalism.

The customers who are prepared, organized, and value their time will pay $500-900 without blinking.

The customers who want you to absorb all the risk and wait around for hours are NOT your customers - even if they're the only ones calling today.

**Your job is to fill your calendar with the RIGHT customers, not just ANY customers.**

This pricing strategy does that.

Now go implement it and report back in 2 weeks.

You've got this.
