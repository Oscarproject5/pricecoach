# Google Ads Optimization Strategy - Stop Bleeding Money

## The Brutal Truth About Your Current Economics

**Google Ads Spend:** $2,000/month
**Cost per click:** $5
**Total clicks per month:** 400 clicks
**Jobs per month:** 20
**Conversion rate:** 5% (20 ÷ 400)
**Cost per job acquisition:** $100 per job ($2,000 ÷ 20)

---

## Your REAL Profit Per Job (The Numbers You Didn't Know)

### Current Model

**Revenue per job:** $500
**Direct costs:** $140 (fuel, tolls, etc.)
**Google Ads cost per job:** $100
**NET PROFIT PER JOB: $260**

### Breakdown by Job Type

**The 7 Full-Day Disaster Jobs:**
- Net profit: $260
- Time invested: 8+ hours
- **Hourly rate: $32.50/hour**
- Total profit from these: $1,820
- Total time used: 7 full days

**The 13 Short Jobs:**
- Net profit: $260
- Time invested: 3-4 hours
- **Hourly rate: $65-87/hour**
- Total profit from these: $3,380
- Total time used: ~6.5 days

### Your Actual Monthly Take-Home

$260 × 20 jobs = **$5,200/month net profit**

**You're spending 20% of your gross revenue on Google Ads.**
(Industry standard for service businesses: 10-15% max)

---

## Why You're Stuck and Can't Grow

**The Vicious Cycle:**

1. Spend $2,000 on ads
2. Get 400 clicks (mostly price shoppers attracted by "$500" in your ads)
3. Convert only 20 jobs at $500 each
4. Gross revenue: $10,000
5. After costs ($2,800) and ads ($2,000): Net $5,200
6. No money left to invest in growth, better equipment, or yourself
7. Can't afford to turn down bad jobs because "I paid for that lead!"
8. Repeat next month

**You're working 40+ days per month to net $5,200.**

That's not sustainable. That's not a business. That's an expensive job.

---

## The Sunk Cost Fallacy - Why You're Taking Bad Leads

**Your current thought process:**
> "I paid $5 for that click → Customer calls → They're disorganized/not ready → But I paid for this lead! → I paid $100 in ads to get this customer! → I better take the job or I wasted the ad money → Take bad $500 job → Lose entire day → Make $32.50/hour"

**This is the SUNK COST FALLACY and it's destroying your profitability.**

### The Real Math on "Losing" a Lead

**Scenario A: You Take the Bad Lead**
- Google Ads cost: $100 (cost per acquisition)
- Revenue: $500
- Direct costs: $140
- Time: 8 hours (entire day)
- Net profit: $260
- **Hourly rate: $32.50/hour**
- **Opportunity cost: You COULD have done 2 load-ready jobs = $1,000 revenue, $520 net profit**
- **Real cost of taking this bad lead: -$260 in lost opportunity**

**Scenario B: You Decline the Bad Lead**
- Google Ads sunk cost: $100 (yes, you "lost" this)
- You keep your day open for GOOD leads
- You take 2 load-ready jobs: $1,000 revenue
- Costs: $280
- **Net profit: $520 (even after absorbing the $100 wasted ad cost)**

**By "losing" the $100 lead, you MADE $260 more and saved your sanity.**

---

## The Solution: Optimize Your Ads + Raise Prices Simultaneously

You need to do BOTH at the same time. Just raising prices won't work if your ads keep attracting price shoppers. Just optimizing ads won't work if your prices are too low to be profitable with $100 CAC.

---

## STEP 1: Fix Your Google Ads (TODAY)

### What You're Probably Doing Wrong

**Current ad copy (probably):**
- "Stepdeck Hauling $500"
- "Affordable Stepdeck Service - 30 Mile Radius"
- "Cheap Stepdeck Transport - Call Now!"

**This attracts:**
- Price shoppers
- Disorganized customers
- First-time haulers with no equipment
- People looking for the cheapest option (NOT the best option)

### What You Should Do Instead

**Stop advertising the price.** Period.

Advertising "$500" is a magnet for people who care ONLY about price, not quality, speed, or professionalism.

---

### NEW Ad Strategy: Create TWO Campaigns

#### Campaign A: Premium Load-Ready Service

- best price

---

#### Campaign B: Full-Service Stepdeck

**Target audience:** Customers who need help with loading
**Budget:** $800/month
**Expected conversions:** 6-8 jobs/month at $900+ each

---

### Landing Page Requirements

**You MUST have a landing page that pre-qualifies leads.**

Right at the top of your page:

---

# Professional Stepdeck Hauling - 30 Mile Radius

## Fast Quote: Is Your Load Ready?

**Choose your service level:**

### ✅ Load-Ready Service
**For customers with equipment on-site**

Your load must be:
- Ready and accessible when we arrive
- Equipment (forklift/crane) on-site and operational

- Paperwork prepared

**Starting at $600**

---

### 🔧 Full-Service Coordination
**For customers who need loading assistance**

We coordinate:
- Loading equipment rental/service
- Synchronized timing
- All logistics from pickup to delivery

**Starting at $900**

[Get Full-Service Quote Button]

---

**This pre-qualification happens BEFORE they call you, saving you time and attracting better-fit customers.**

---

## STEP 2: Raise Your Prices to Account for Ad Costs

Your current $500 pricing doesn't account for the $100 customer acquisition cost.

### New Pricing Structure

**Tier 1: Load-Ready Jobs - $600**
(Was $500 - $100 increase)

- Load ready when you arrive
- Equipment on-site and operational
- Maximum 15-minute wait
- Professional customers only

**Why $600:**
- Revenue: $600
- Direct costs: $140
- Ad cost per job: $100
- **Net profit: $360 per job** (39% more than before)
- Takes 3-4 hours
- **Hourly rate: $90-120/hour**

---

**Tier 2: Assisted/Coordinated Loading - $900-1,000**

- Customer arranges loading service
- You coordinate timing
- Load is prepared but needs equipment
- More complex logistics

**Why $900:**
- Revenue: $900
- Direct costs: $140
- Ad cost per job: $100
- **Net profit: $660 per job**
- Takes 4-5 hours
- **Hourly rate: $132-165/hour**

---

**Tier 3: Complex Jobs - $1,500+ or DECLINE**

- Unprepared loads
- Wait time required
- Uncertain timeline
- High risk of failure

**Why $1,500 minimum:**
- Revenue: $1,500
- Direct costs: $140
- Ad cost: $100
- **Net profit: $1,260**
- Takes 8+ hours
- **Hourly rate: $157/hour**

**OR - Don't take these at all.**

---

## STEP 3: New Customer Qualification Script (With Ad Costs in Mind)

When a lead calls from your ad, use this script:

**You:** "Thanks for calling! I saw you came from our website. Are you looking at our Load-Ready service or Full-Service coordination?"

*(This reminds them they already saw two price points)*

**Customer:** "Uh, what's the difference?"

**You:** "Load-Ready is for customers who have their own forklift or loading equipment on-site and ready when I arrive. That service starts at $600 for our 30-mile radius. Full-Service is when we help coordinate loading equipment or services, and that starts at $900. Which situation fits your needs?"

---

### If They Push Back on Price

**Customer:** "That's more expensive than I expected. I saw other companies for $500."

**You:** "I understand. Here's what's different: I run a professional operation with reliable equipment and service. My Load-Ready rate of $600 ensures I show up on time, your load gets hauled safely, and there are no surprises. The $500 companies you're seeing might not account for all their costs - or they might keep you waiting for days.

If you're looking for the absolute cheapest option, I might not be the best fit. But if you value your time and need this done right the first time, I'm your guy. What matters more to you - lowest price or reliable service?"

**Let them decide. If they choose price, let them go.**

---

### If They Say "$600 Is Too Much"

**You:** "I totally understand budget matters. Let me ask - do you have loading equipment on-site and ready to go? Because if not, you're actually looking at our Full-Service tier at $900, not $600."

*(Often this makes $600 seem more reasonable)*

**If they still balk:**

**You:** "No problem. I appreciate you reaching out. If the other company doesn't work out or you decide you want professional service, feel free to call back. Good luck with your haul!"

**End the call. Don't chase.**

---

## Week-by-Week Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Google Ads Overhaul

**Day 1-2: Campaign Setup**
- [ ] Pause all current campaigns
- [ ] Create Campaign A: "Premium Load-Ready"
- [ ] Create Campaign B: "Full-Service"
- [ ] Remove ALL price mentions from ad copy
- [ ] Add qualifying language: "Equipment Required" / "Load-Ready"
- [ ] Set budgets: $1,000 Campaign A, $800 Campaign B
- [ ] Add negative keywords: cheap, affordable, discount, free

**Day 3-4: Landing Page**
- [ ] Create or update landing page with two-tier qualifier
- [ ] Add clear CTA buttons for each service level
- [ ] Include testimonials if you have them (if not, get some!)
- [ ] Add photos of your equipment
- [ ] Make sure mobile-friendly

**Day 5-7: Launch and Monitor**
- [ ] Launch new campaigns
- [ ] Track cost per click (should stay around $5)
- [ ] Monitor initial conversion rate
- [ ] Track which tier customers are inquiring about

---

### Week 2: Price Implementation

**Day 1: Update All Materials**
- [ ] Update your voicemail script
- [ ] Update email signature with new positioning
- [ ] Practice new qualification script out loud
- [ ] Write down your new pricing (post it where you can see it)

**Day 2-7: Apply New Pricing**
- [ ] Quote $600 for ALL load-ready jobs (no exceptions)
- [ ] Quote $900 for assisted jobs
- [ ] Track objection rate (how many people push back)
- [ ] Track close rate on new pricing
- [ ] DO NOT discount - hold firm

**Expect:**
- 30-40% of prospects will object to price
- That's GOOD - these are price shoppers you don't want
- Your close rate might drop from 5% to 4%
- But your profit per job goes up 39%

---

### Week 3: Optimize Based on Data

**What to Track:**
- Cost per click (target: $5)
- Click-through rate (target: 3-5%)
- Conversion rate (target: 4-6%)
- Average job value (target: $650+)
- Net profit per job (target: $400+)
- Lead quality (subjective: are they prepared?)

**Adjustments to Make:**
- If cost per click goes up to $7-8: Pause underperforming keywords
- If conversion rate drops below 3%: Your prices might be too high OR your ad targeting is off
- If getting mostly Tier 2 inquiries: Increase Tier 2 budget, decrease Tier 1
- If getting too many unqualified leads: Add more negative keywords

---

### Week 4: Double Down on What Works

**Analyze Your First Month:**
- Which campaign performed better?
- What keywords drove the most conversions?
- What ad copy got the most clicks?
- What's your new average job value?
- What's your new net profit?

**Scale What's Working:**
- Increase budget on high-performing campaign by 20%
- Pause underperforming ad variations
- Add more keywords similar to what's converting
- Create new ad copy based on successful patterns

---

## Red Flags in Your Google Ads Data

**Warning signs you're still attracting bad leads:**

- High click-through rate (8%+) but low conversion (under 3%)
  - **Fix:** Your ads are too broad, add more qualifying language

- Cost per click increasing rapidly ($7-10+)
  - **Fix:** You're competing with others on generic terms, get more specific

- High conversion rate (8%+) but jobs are still disasters
  - **Fix:** Your landing page isn't pre-qualifying enough, make requirements clearer

- Most inquiries are for Tier 1 but they don't have equipment
  - **Fix:** Make "Equipment Required" more prominent in ads

- Getting calls asking "what's your cheapest price?"
  - **Fix:** Add negative keywords, remove any cost/savings language from ads

---

## How to Handle the Transition Period (Weeks 1-4)

### What Will Happen

**Week 1:**
- Fewer leads than before (panic will set in - this is normal)
- Most leads will be better quality
- Some will still push back on price
- You'll be tempted to drop prices - DON'T

**Week 2:**
- Conversion rate stabilizes
- You start booking jobs at $600
- First few customers at new price go smoothly
- You realize they don't push back as much as you feared

**Week 3:**
- Revenue starts matching old levels
- But profit is MUCH higher
- You have more open days (feels weird but it's good)
- You start to relax and trust the process

**Week 4:**
- New normal established
- Better customers calling
- Higher revenue per job
- More profit
- Less stress

### If You Panic and Want to Go Back to $500

**DON'T.**

Here's the math on why:

**Going back to $500:**
- You'll get more leads, yes
- But you'll be back to $260 net profit per job
- Back to taking disasters to fill your calendar
- Back to $5,200/month net
- Back to being stuck

**Staying at $600:**
- Fewer leads, but better quality
- $360 net profit per job
- Can afford to turn down bad jobs
- Path to $8,000-12,000/month net
- Sustainable growth

**Which do you want?**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "What if I can't get enough leads at $600?"

Then you have a marketing problem, not a pricing problem.

**Solutions:**
- Improve your Google Ads targeting
- Add local SEO (Google Business Profile)
- Ask happy customers for referrals
- Join local business groups
- Partner with equipment rental companies

But going back to $500 isn't the answer. You can't grow at $500 with $100 CAC.

---

### "What if competitors are still at $450-500?"

Let them be. They're either:
1. Not accounting for their real costs (and will go out of business)
2. Running a different business model than you
3. Lying about their prices (happens more than you think)

You're running a PROFESSIONAL operation with $2,000/month in marketing costs. You can't compete on price. You compete on:
- Reliability
- Professionalism
- Responsiveness
- Quality of service

---

### "Should I tell customers why my price is higher?"

Not usually. But if they ask directly:

**Customer:** "Why are you more expensive than [competitor]?"

**You:** "That's a fair question. I run a professional operation with commercial insurance, maintained equipment, and reliable service. I show up when I say I will, your load gets there safely, and you can track me in real-time. Some companies cut costs by skipping insurance, using older equipment, or overbooking their schedule.

I'm not the cheapest option - I'm the professional option. If lowest price is your priority, I totally understand, but if reliability and peace of mind matter, I'm worth the difference."

---

### "What if my Google Ads don't improve?"

Give it 30 days. If after 30 days you're still getting poor quality leads:

**Possible issues:**
1. Your ad copy isn't filtering well enough
2. Your landing page doesn't pre-qualify
3. Your keywords are too broad
4. Your service area is too competitive
5. You need to try other marketing channels

**Next steps:**
- Consider hiring a Google Ads specialist ($500-1,000 to audit and optimize)
- Try local SEO and Google Business Profile (free)
- Ask for referrals from past good customers
- Partner with equipment rental companies who can refer you

But don't go back to $500 flat pricing. That's a death spiral.

## The Bottom Line

**You're currently spending $2,000/month on Google Ads to net $5,200.**

**That's 38% of your net profit going to Google.**

By optimizing your ads AND raising your prices, you can:
- Spend $1,500/month on ads (25% less)
- Net $9,000-12,000/month (73-130% more)
- Work with better customers
- Build a sustainable business

**The alternative is staying stuck at $5,200/month, taking bad jobs, and burning out.**

Which path do you choose?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Today:** Pause current Google Ads campaigns
2. **This week:** Set up new campaigns with better targeting
3. **This week:** Update all pricing to $600/$900/$1,500
4. **Next 30 days:** Track metrics and optimize
5. **Day 31:** Review results and adjust

You've got this. Now go implement it.

**Remember:** Not all leads are created equal. A $5 click that turns into a $32/hour disaster is worth LESS than a $5 click you walk away from to keep your day open for a $90/hour profitable job.

Stop chasing volume. Start chasing profit.
